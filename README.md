    -Leopard Gecko Care Sheets
    - I see a lot of leopard geckos that do not recieve proper care becasue they are bought by people who haven't done the proper research 


## The elevator Pitch

[A one sentence pitch for your game.]
Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds.

## Project Description:

An educational leopard gecko to teach prospective owners the basics of leopard geckos.  While this won't be a completely realistic simulator, 
the user will collect leopard gecko care knowledge through the game.  

The goal is to teach the users: 
- Proper Heating requirements
- Proper Food
- Day/Night cycles 
- Proper Humidity Requirements
- different illnesses leopard geckos could face:
Metabolic Bone Disease
Parasites
Stuck Shed 
Respiratory disease



# What sets this project apart?
  - Games that include leopard geckos are not common 
  - Not many virtual pet games teach their audience about proper pet management 
  - Leopard geckos!
